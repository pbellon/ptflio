This project is a personnal experimentation of how we can use a
data-driven tools like [D3.js][d3] to explore a Philosophy piece like
the Tractatus logico-philosophicus (Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung
in its original name).

This book published in 1921 was written by Ludwig Wittgenstein.
Its numbered propositions follows a tree structure,(1, then 1.1, 1.2 etc.)
which made me think we could easily visualize it.
