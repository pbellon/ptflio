How do the french media perceive Islam and Muslims ? That's the big question that lead to this project at Skoli. We wanted to check some popular assumptions that either accused medias of islamophobia or islamophilia. To do that we based our study on the quantification of the mediatic treatment of Islam (and muslims).

To have more details on this project and the analysis model put in place please read [this article][ddj_iom] I've written. You can also read [this article about how we dealt with duplicates][medium_duplicates] and [this one talking about our analysis model][medium_sklearn]
