This serious game put you at the head of Habinat, a leader of construction. Everybody see you as a succesful entrepeneur, until that night, when your talented right-hand engineer and designer of the company's main product is found dead, by suicide.

Now you have to face the mediatic storm that is coming, helped by Patrick Luaud, a famous communication advisor, a "spin doctor".<br/>
Will you do the *right* choices ?
