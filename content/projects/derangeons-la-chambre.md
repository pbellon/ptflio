What would have been the results of the french legislative elections if we applied a different set of rules? What would it have been if we applied, for instance, the Spain legislative ballot rules? Or the ones from Italy?
Would we have a similar assembly if the abstention was counted as a party?
That's to all those questions that "Dérangeons la Chambre" (Upset The Room) tries to answer.

I was in charge of the realization of this project at Skoli and Raul Magni Berton
